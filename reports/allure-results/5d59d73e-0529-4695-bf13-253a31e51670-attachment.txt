Step-by-Step Guide: How to Renew Your UAE Visa

Renewing your UAE residence visa is a straightforward process if you follow the correct steps and prepare the required documents in advance. Below is a comprehensive, up-to-date guide based on official sources and expert recommendations.

1. When to Start the Renewal Process
Begin your visa renewal process up to 30 days before your current visa expires.
There is a 30-day grace period after expiry, but renewing before expiry helps avoid fines or legal issues.
Golden Visa and Green Visa holders may have extended grace periods; check your specific category for details 5.
2. Choose Your Renewal Channel

You can renew your visa through any of the following official channels:

Online Portals:
Federal Authority for Identity, Citizenship, Customs, and Port Security (ICP)
General Directorate of Residency and Foreigners Affairs (GDRFA) website: 1
GDRFA Dubai Smart App or DubaiNow App
In-Person:
AMER Centers (for Dubai residents)
Authorized typing centers 4
3. Prepare Required Documents

Commonly required documents include:

Sponsor’s documents (for family visas: salary certificate, labor contract, etc.)
Additional documents for dependents (e.g., study certificate for male children over 18, marriage certificate for daughters over 18) 3
4. Complete Medical Fitness Test
Schedule and attend a medical fitness test at an authorized center.
Tests usually include blood tests and a chest X-ray.
Submit the medical fitness certificate with your renewal application 5.
5. Renew Your Emirates ID

This is mandatory as per the latest regulations.
6. Submit Your Application
Upload or submit all required documents through your chosen channel (online portal or service center).
Pay the applicable renewal fees (varies by visa type and emirate).
Fees may include: application/typing fees, medical test fees, insurance, and visa stamping fees 5.
7. Wait for Approval
Processing time is typically 3–10 business days, depending on the emirate and completeness of your application.
Dubai often has faster processing due to its digital infrastructure 5.
8. Receive Your Updated Visa & Emirates ID
Once approved, your new visa will be stamped in your passport.
Collect your renewed Emirates ID when notified.
