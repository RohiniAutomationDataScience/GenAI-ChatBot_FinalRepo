Step-by-Step Guide: How to Renew Your UAE Visa

Renewing your UAE residence visa is a straightforward process if you follow the correct steps and prepare the necessary documents in advance. Below is a clear, step-by-step guide based on the latest official procedures and expert recommendations.

1. When to Start the Renewal Process
Begin your visa renewal process up to 30 days before your current visa expires.
There is a 30-day grace period after expiry, but it is best to renew before your visa lapses to avoid fines or legal issues.
Sponsors (employers or family members) are responsible for renewing dependent visas within this period.
