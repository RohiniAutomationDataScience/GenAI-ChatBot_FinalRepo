Step-by-Step Guide: Renewing Your Emirates ID

Renewing your Emirates ID is a straightforward process, but it’s important to follow each step carefully to avoid delays or fines. Below is a detailed, step-by-step guide for both UAE citizens and expatriate residents.

1. When to Renew
You can apply for renewal between 6 months and 30 days before your Emirates ID expires.
After expiry, you have a 30-day grace period to renew. Late fines of AED 20 per day apply after this period 2.
2. Prepare Required Documents

The documents required may vary depending on your status (citizen, GCC national, or expatriate). Commonly required documents include:

Original Emirates ID (expiring/expired)
Valid passport
Valid UAE residence visa (for expatriates)
Recent passport-sized photo (white background)
For children: Birth certificate and parents’ documents

Check the ICP website for the latest and complete list: 2

3. Submit Your Application

You can apply for renewal through one of the following channels:

Online via the ICP website or ICP App (available on Google Play, App Store, and Huawei)
Accredited typing centers
ICP Customer Happiness Centres

For online applications, fill in the renewal form and upload the required documents. You will receive an SMS or email confirmation after submission 1.

4. Pay the Renewal Fees
The standard renewal fee is AED 270.
Additional service charges may apply depending on the channel used.
If you need the card urgently, you can pay an extra fee for express service (Fawri), available for UAE and GCC nationals. Expatriates can use this only for replacement, not renewal 2.
5. Biometrics (If Required)
Applicants above 15 years old may need to visit an ICP service center for fingerprinting and a photo.
You will be notified via SMS if this step is required.
6. Track Application Status
You will receive SMS updates about your application status.
You can also check the status online via the ICP website.
7. Collect Your New Emirates ID
Once ready, you will receive an SMS notification.
Collect your card from the selected ICP Customer Happiness Centre or opt for home delivery via courier.
8. Important Notes
Ensure your UAE residence visa is valid before applying (for expatriates).
If your Emirates ID is lost or damaged, report it and apply for a replacement immediately.
For any queries, contact the ICP Call Centre at 6005 30003 or visit the ICP website.
