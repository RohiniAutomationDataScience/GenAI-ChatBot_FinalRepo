Step-by-Step Guide: Renewing Your UAE Visa

Renewing your UAE residence visa is a straightforward process if you follow the correct steps and prepare the required documents in advance. Below is a clear, step-by-step guide based on the latest official information:

1. When to Start
Begin your renewal process up to 30 days before your current visa expires.
Renewing on time helps you avoid fines and ensures uninterrupted access to work, education, healthcare, and other services in the UAE.
There is typically a 30-day grace period after expiry, but it is best to renew before your visa expires to avoid complications. 4
2. Prepare Required Documents

Common documents needed include:

Original passport (valid for at least 6 months)
Current Emirates ID
Passport-sized photographs
Copy of your current visa
Tenancy contract or proof of accommodation (Ejari, if in Dubai)
Medical insurance (as per emirate requirements)
Sponsor’s documents (if applicable)
Additional documents for family members (e.g., study certificate for male children over 18, marriage certificate for daughters over 18)
Any other documents as specified by your visa type or emirate 7
3. Complete Medical Fitness Test
Schedule and undergo a medical fitness test at an authorized center.
Tests usually include blood tests and a chest X-ray.
Medical fitness is mandatory for most visa categories. 6
4. Apply for Emirates ID Renewal
